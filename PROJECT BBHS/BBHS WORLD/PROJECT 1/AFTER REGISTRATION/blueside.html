    <h1>Blue Side (Defensive)</h1>
    <p>
      The Blue Side, also known as Defensive Security, focuses on protecting and
      defending an organization's information systems from cyber threats. Blue
      Team members are responsible for implementing security measures to prevent
      attacks, monitoring systems for suspicious activity, and responding to
      security incidents to mitigate damage. Their work involves a combination
      of proactive strategies, such as setting up firewalls, intrusion detection
      systems, and secure network designs, as well as reactive strategies like
      incident response and forensics. The goal of the Blue Team is to ensure
      the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of an organization's data
      by identifying vulnerabilities, applying patches, and continuously
      improving security protocols. Their efforts are crucial in maintaining a
      strong security posture and safeguarding against the ever-evolving
      landscape of cyber threats.

    <h2><u>Network Security Analyst</u></h2>
    <p>
      A Network Security Analyst specializes in safeguarding an organization's
      network infrastructure against unauthorized access and cyber threats. They
      deploy and manage security tools like firewalls, intrusion detection
      systems (IDS), and secure network designs. Network Security Analysts play
      a crucial role in maintaining data confidentiality and integrity by
      implementing robust security protocols and conducting regular security
      audits. They are adept at identifying and mitigating network
      vulnerabilities to ensure the organization's network remains secure and
      resilient against evolving cyber threats.
