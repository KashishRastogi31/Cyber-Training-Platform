    <h1>Purple Side (Hybrid)</h1>
    <p>
      The Purple Side, also known as Hybrid Security, combines both Offensive
      (Red Team) and Defensive (Blue Team) security strategies to create a more
      comprehensive security posture. Purple Team members work to bridge the gap
      between attack simulation and defense mechanisms, ensuring that the
      insights gained from offensive testing are effectively used to improve
      defensive measures. Their goal is to enhance collaboration between the Red
      and Blue Teams, promoting continuous improvement in an organization's
      overall security strategy through a feedback loop of simulated attacks and
      defensive improvements.

    <h2><u>Threat Intelligence Analyst</u></h2>
    <p>
      Threat Intelligence Analysts focus on gathering, analyzing, and
      interpreting information about current and emerging cyber threats. They
      monitor various sources of threat data, including open-source intelligence
      (OSINT), dark web forums, and threat feeds, to identify potential risks.
      By understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threat
      actors, they provide actionable intelligence to improve an organization's
      security posture. Their work is essential in anticipating and mitigating
      cyber threats before they can cause significant harm.
