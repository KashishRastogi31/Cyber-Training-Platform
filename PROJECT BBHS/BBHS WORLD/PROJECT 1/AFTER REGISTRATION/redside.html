    <h1>Red Side (Offensive)</h1>
    <p>
      The Red Side, also known as Offensive Security, focuses on simulating
      cyber attacks to test and improve an organization's defenses. Red Team
      members take on the role of adversaries, conducting ethical hacking,
      penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses
      in systems, networks, and applications. Their goal is to provide insights
      into potential security gaps and help organizations strengthen their
      security posture by recommending improvements. By understanding the
      tactics, techniques, and procedures of real-world attackers, Red Team
      professionals help to enhance the overall resilience of the organization
      against cyber threats.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Penetration Tester</u></h2>
    <p>
      Penetration Testers, or ethical hackers, are experts in finding and
      exploiting vulnerabilities within an organization's systems, networks, and
      applications. They conduct simulated attacks to assess the security
      posture, identify weaknesses, and provide actionable recommendations for
      remediation. Penetration Testers use a variety of tools and techniques to
      mimic real-world cyber threats, helping organizations to understand
      potential risks and improve their defenses. Their work is crucial in
      proactively identifying security issues before they can be exploited by
      malicious actors.

    </ul>

    <h2><u>Ethical Hacker</u></h2>
    <p>
      Ethical Hackers use their skills to identify and exploit vulnerabilities
      in an organization’s systems with permission, aiming to strengthen the
      security posture. They conduct thorough assessments of networks,
      applications, and devices, using the same techniques as malicious hackers.
      Ethical Hackers provide detailed reports of their findings and suggest
      measures to mitigate identified risks. Their proactive approach helps
      organizations stay ahead of potential threats and continuously improve
      their cybersecurity defenses.

    </ul>

    <h2><u>Red Team Operator</u></h2>
    <p>
      Red Team Operators conduct advanced adversarial simulations to evaluate
      and improve an organization’s security defenses. They use a range of
      tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to mimic real-world cyber
      threats, testing the effectiveness of defensive measures. Red Team
      Operators collaborate closely with Blue Teams to identify gaps and improve
      incident response capabilities. Their work is instrumental in providing a
      realistic assessment of an organization’s security posture and helping to
      develop robust defense strategies.

    <p>
      Vulnerability Assessors specialize in identifying and evaluating security
      weaknesses within an organization’s systems, networks, and applications.
      They conduct systematic scans and assessments to discover vulnerabilities
      and provide detailed reports on their findings. Vulnerability Assessors
      prioritize risks and recommend remediation measures to mitigate potential
      threats. Their work is essential in maintaining a proactive security
      posture by continuously monitoring for and addressing vulnerabilities
      before they can be exploited.
